# Movie Nerds


## Description

As movie enthusiasts, we decided to create this project to quickly get information about a films and find a place to stream our favorite films. We used server side APIs and JavaScript to dynamically display information on multiple movies and links to streaming services. We learned how to use the Materialize CSS framework to style the page and ensure that the page is response on multiple screen sizes.
